More things I should add:

- streak tracking
- a login so people can save their list
- a database to save the login info
- 3 bar drop down menu
- sort of calendar that'll track daily progress
- have the calendar also be able to show todos done that day
- choice to randomly select what to do to work on
- allow preference for different task lengths for the random select
- determine if the value attribute is needed for the checkbox items
* hide streak on mobile
