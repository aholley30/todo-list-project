More things I should add:

- streak tracking
- be able to edit and remove todos
- a login so people can save their list
- a database to save the login info and list
* 3 bar drop down menu
- sort of calendar that'll track daily progress
- have the calendar also be able to show todos done that day
- choice to randomly select what to do to work on
- determine if the value attribute is needed for the checkbox items
* hide streak on mobile

* Add a separate javascript file.
- Make the item tracking more efficient.
- Save list history
- right click to edit items

What I want: 
A todo list that'll be like a daily planner. 
I can look at previous days accomplishments but I can't edit them.
I can add, edit, and remove items at will.
When I refresh the page, all changes persist.
I have my own user account.
The website fetches data from a database based on login info.
